# Ethermine_Tracker
Uses Selenium to get the hashrate of all of the workers/computers that are mining to your pool and stores it in a csv file.

Used to track the amount mined per worker over a long period of time.

This is the program for you if you have multiple people using their computers to mine to one address and want to fairly divy up profits.
